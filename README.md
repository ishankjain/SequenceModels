# SequenceModels
Projects on Sequence Models completed during the course  "Sequence Models" by deeplearning.ai on Coursera:  
  
-> Implemented RNN from scratch.  
-> Build and train a Character level language model.  
-> Apply an LSTM to music generation and generate your own jazz music with deep learning.  
-> Emojifier, finds the most appropriate emoji to be used with a sentence using LSTM.  
-> Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate human readable dates ("25th of June, 2009") into machine readable dates ("2009-06-25").  
-> Structure a speech recognition project, synthesize and process audio recordings to create train/dev datasets and train a trigger word detection model and make predictions.
